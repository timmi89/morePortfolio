            Any self-respecting demon should be living in a pit of filth or a nice crypt....I'm still on speakerphone aren't I?

I figure, if I'm responsible for the end of the world, I get to name it. Who's calling me? And you know the monkey's just,'I mock you with my monkey pants!' And what's with all the carrots? How did your brain even learn human speech? I'm just so curious. Shh! No programs, don't use that word.

u can't open the book of my life and jump in the middle. got a bunch of fighters with nothing to hit, a wicca who won't-a, rning on a dime, salmon trucking upstream.

Better to cut you down to size, grandma.  I am never gonna see a merman, ever.  We will bring you the limp and beaten body of Bob Barker! Barmaid, bring me stronger ale, and some plump, succulent babies to eat. Did you know that the only animal in the animals crackers that has clothes is the monkey? Ah, the pitter patter of tiny feet in huge combat boots.
